# A PyTorch Implementation of DenseNet

This is a [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of the
DenseNet-BC architecture as described in the
paper [Densely Connected Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993)
by G. Huang, Z. Liu, K. Weinberger, and L. van der Maaten.
Their official implementation and links to many other
third-party implementations are available in the
[liuzhuang13/DenseNet](https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet)
repo on GitHub.

This repo is not complete and I'll fill in more details
here soon. We just overcame a PyTorch bug that you
can learn more about [here](attic/debug-log.md).
PyTorch master will soon contain a cudnn patch making the
code in this repo work.
